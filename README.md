# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and societies, necessitating a swift and coordinated response from nations worldwide. One crucial aspect of this response has been the rollout of vaccination campaigns to curb the spread of the virus. This data science project aims to delve into the vaccination data of countries around the world, with a specific focus on Europe and a keen eye on Italy. By examining the vaccination trends and patterns, we seek to gain valuable insights into the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts and the factors influencing their success.

To predict the vaccination rates based on various factors such as population, healthcare infrastructure, and government policies has been developed and trained a linear regression model to predict vaccination rates.

The [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saliblue/country-vaccinations/data) that has been used was downloaded from Kaggle.

The [Covid-19 Vaccines Analysis](https://github.com/GianlucaBarbiere/Covid19-Vaccines-Analysis/blob/main/Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Analysis.ipynb) can be seen via this link.

The project's primary objectives include:
1. Data Collection and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. World-Focused Analysis
6. Europe-Focused Analysis
7. Linear Regression Model

This project's significance lies in its potential to inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public about the efficacy of vaccination efforts, highlight successful strategies, and identify areas requiring intervention. The utilization of a linear regression model adds a predictive dimension, helping to anticipate future vaccination trends and outcomes based on historical data.
